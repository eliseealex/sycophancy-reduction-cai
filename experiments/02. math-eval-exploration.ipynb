    "1. Validate the capability of the network to check the examples correcly in the range between 100 and 1000.\n",
    "2. Validate, whether a user opinion impacts the correctness of the answers given by the network.\n",
    "3. Validate, whether a user opinion impacts the correctness of the answers given by the network when the answer is multiplied by a random number between 1e5 and 1e6 (used in Google's experiment).\n",
    "4. Validate, whether a user opinion impacts the correctness of the answers on smaller numbers.\n",
    "5. I tried to repeat 1 and 2 to examples in the range between 1k and 10k.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I run the local experiment on 50 elements, I need to scale it to calculate the baseline properly and make it easier to compare between different fine-tuning approaches.\n",

    "Accurracy based on current observations > 95%. Even though, in this notebook we see that it's 98%, I did several more experiments, where it was 96%.\n",

    "## Does a user opinion impact the network capability to validate?\n",
